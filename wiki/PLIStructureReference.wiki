= PL/I Structure Abstract Syntax Tree =

The first step in converting a PL/I structure to a COBOL structure is to parse the PL/I structure code into an Abstract Syntax Tree.

In legstar-pli2cob, this is achieved using [http://www.antlr.org/ ANTLR]. The starting points are a [http://code.google.com/p/legstar-pli2cob/source/browse/trunk/src/main/antlr3/com/legstar/pli2cob/PLIStructureLexer.g lexer]
and a [http://code.google.com/p/legstar-pli2cob/source/browse/trunk/src/main/antlr3/com/legstar/pli2cob/PLIStructureParser.g parser] grammar.

Most of the parsing code is automatically generated by ANTLR.

The following graph shows all the attributes that are recognized by the parser and how they relate to each other:
