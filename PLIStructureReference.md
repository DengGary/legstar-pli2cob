# PL/I Structure Abstract Syntax Tree #

The first step in converting a PL/I structure to a COBOL structure is to parse the PL/I structure code into an Abstract Syntax Tree.

In legstar-pli2cob, this is achieved using [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/). The starting points are a [lexer](http://code.google.com/p/legstar-pli2cob/source/browse/trunk/src/main/antlr3/com/legstar/pli2cob/PLIStructureLexer.g)
and a [parser](http://code.google.com/p/legstar-pli2cob/source/browse/trunk/src/main/antlr3/com/legstar/pli2cob/PLIStructureParser.g) grammar.

Most of the parsing code is automatically generated by ANTLR.

The following graph shows all the attributes that are recognized by the parser and how they relate to each other:
